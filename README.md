# Broken Keyboard
Help! My keyboard is broken, only a few keys work any more. If I tell you what keys work, can you tell me what words I can write?
(You should use the dictionary.txt file to chose your valid English words from.)

## Input Description
You'll be given a line with a single integer on it, telling you how many lines to read. Then you'll be given that many lines, each line a list of letters representing the keys that work on my keyboard. Example:

```
3
abcd
qwer
hjklo
```

## Output Description
Your program should emit the longest valid English language word you can make for each keyboard configuration.

```
abcd = bacaba
qwer = ewerer
hjklo = kolokolo
```
## Challenge Input
```
4
edcf
bnik
poil
vybu
```

## Challenge Output
```
edcf = deedeed
bnik = bikini
poil = pililloo
vybu = bubby
